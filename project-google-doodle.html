    <h2>Overview</h2>
    <p>This animated Google Doodle celebrates Indonesia’s Independence Day (August 17) through movement, music, and national symbols. The design combines Soekarno’s silhouette, the Garuda, the national flag, and a torch of freedom within the Google logo. When activated, the doodle plays Indonesia’s independence anthem while animated elements bring the celebration to life, capturing unity, pride, and cultural identity in a single interactive experience.</p>

    <h2>Process Outline</h2>

    <h3>Project Brief</h3>
    <p>Create a Google Doodle that celebrates Indonesia’s Independence Day by incorporating motion, symbolism, and interactivity.</p>

    <h3>Concept and Research</h3>
    <p>I started by listing key national symbols such as the red-and-white flag, the Garuda, and Soekarno, and explored how they could merge with the Google logo while keeping it readable. The goal was to express pride and celebration through motion and sound.</p>

    <h3>Sketching and Design Development</h3>
    <p>Using Procreate, I illustrated the logo and experimented with how each letter could carry symbolic meaning. The torch’s flame represents resilience, the waving flag stands for unity, and Soekarno’s raised hand symbolizes independence. Color and rhythm were inspired by Indonesia’s national anthem.</p>

    <h3>Animation and Interactivity</h3>
    <p>The doodle was animated frame by frame, with movements timed to the anthem. In Adobe Aero, I added interactivity so that pressing the play button activates both sound and animation, creating a short but immersive celebration.</p>

    <h3>Reflection</h3>
    <p>This project helped me understand how motion and sound strengthen emotional storytelling. The combination of symbolism, music, and interactivity turned a static logo into an experience that feels personal and alive.</p>
